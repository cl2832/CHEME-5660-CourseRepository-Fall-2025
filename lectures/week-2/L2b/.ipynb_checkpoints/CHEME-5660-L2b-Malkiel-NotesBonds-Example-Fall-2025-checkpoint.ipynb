    "To simulate the impact of changes in the yield (discount) and coupon rate on price, let's perturb the effective nominal yield $\\bar{r}$ for a `high,` `nominal,` and `low` coupon rate, with all other values held constant. We'll generate a new rate of the form $\\bar{r}\\leftarrow\\beta\\cdot\\bar{r}$, where $\\beta$ is a perturbation value; if $\\beta<1$ the perturbed interest rate is _less than_ the nominal rate, if $\\beta=1$ the perturbed interest rate is _equals_ the nominal rate, and if $\\beta>1$ the perturbed interest rate is _greater than_ the nominal rate.\n",

    "* Next, specify the lower bound in the `β₁` variable and the upper bound in the `β₂` variable; let `β₁ = 0.8` and `β₂ = 1.2.`\n",
    "* Finally, we compute the perturbation array (stored in the `β`-variable) using the [range function](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/math/#Base.range) in combination with the [Julia pipe |> operator](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#Function-composition-and-piping), and the [collect function](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Base.collect-Tuple{Type,%20Any}), which converts a range type to a collection, i.e., an array"
